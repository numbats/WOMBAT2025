<hr />

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together analysts from academia, industry and government to learn and discuss new open source tools for business analytics and data science. The theme of this yearâ€™s event is designing data driven discoveries, which will feature talks on statistical software, research collaboration, and impactful data analysis. You should come if you are an analytics professional, or leading a team of analysts or a developer of new open source tools.

Attendance will be limited to 20 participants (in-person and online) for each of the 8 tutorials on day 1, and 100 participants (in-person only) for day 2's workshop. We will also have a rich collection of hex stickers available on both days for all to choose from to decorate your laptop!

Register for one or two tutorials here and the workshop [here](https://events.humanitix.com/open-the-world-with-open-source-wombat-2024-day-2-workshop/).

## Keynote

Reproducible data analysis with Positron

The process of data analysis is inherently iterative and exploratory, requiring continuous review of intermediate results to guide next steps. At the same time, data analysts and data scientists know they need to adopt reproducible methods to maintain the integrity and efficacy of their work. These characteristics of data analysis work can be in tension, but the processes we adopt and the tools we choose to use can bring those tensions into balance. In this talk, learn about the considerations tool creators must consider when building software for these kinds of tasks, as well as how data scientists and other data practitioners can engage in their iterative work while maintaining reproducible workflows. This talk will explore these issues in the context of tools like Quarto and Positron; Positron is a new, next generation integrated development environment (IDE) built to facilitate both exploratory data analysis as well as reproducible practices.
