    "text": "Keynote\n\n\n\n  \n    \n     Nicola Rennie \n     Nicola Rennie is a data visualisation specialist, working at the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom. She has a background in statistics and data science, who is interested in understanding how to effectively communicate quantitative information in an accessible way. She advocates for using open source tools, and has experience in D3, Svelte, R, and Python. Nicola co-authored the Royal Statistical Society’s Best Practices for Data Visualisation guidance and is a member of the Editorial Board of Significance magazine, particularly focused on data visualisation. Nicola is a committee member and secretary of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) Teaching Statistics Section Group, and is also one of the RSS’s 2024-2025 William Guy Lecturers who has recorded and delivered talks aimed at 11-16 year olds on the topic of using data and statistics to shape decision making in medicine and healthcare. She has also previously been a committee member of the R-Ladies Global Team and the R-Ladies Lancaster chapter organiser.\n \n  \n  \n     Designing for decision-making: How to build effective data visualisations \n     Data visualisation can be a very efficient method of identifying patterns in data and communicating findings to broad audiences. Good data visualisation requires appreciation and careful consideration of the technical aspects of data presentation. But it also involves a creative element. Authorial choices are made about the “story” we want to tell, and design decisions are driven by the need to convey that story most effectively to our audience. Software systems use default settings for most graphical elements. However, each visualisation has its own story to tell, and so we must actively consider and choose settings for the visualisation we are building. In this talk, Nicola will showcase why you should visualise data, present some guidelines for making more effective charts, before discussing examples of good and not so good charts.\n \n  \n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nRegistration\nAttendance will be limited to 20 participants (in-person and online) for each of the 8 tutorials on day 1, and 100 participants (in-person only) for day 2’s workshop. We will also have a rich collection of hex stickers available on both days for all to choose from to decorate your laptop!\n\nRegistrations opening soon."

At the same time, data analysts and data scientists know they need to adopt reproducible methods to maintain the integrity and efficacy of their work. These characteristics of data analysis work can be in tension, but the processes we adopt and the tools we choose to use can bring those tensions into balance. In this talk, learn about the considerations tool creators must consider when building software for these kinds of tasks, as well as how data scientists and other data practitioners can engage in their iterative work while maintaining reproducible workflows. This talk will explore these issues in the context of tools like Quarto and Positron; Positron is a new, next generation integrated development environment (IDE) built to facilitate both exploratory data analysis as well as reproducible practices.\n\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      10:00 A.M. - 10:30 A.M.\n      Morning tea\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.\n      Invited talks - Communications and reporting\n      \n      \n        \n          Chair: To be confirmed\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                Speaker: U\n              \n              \n                T\n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                Speaker: Q\n              \n              \n                I\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      12:00 P.M. - 1:00 P.M.\n      Lunch\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      1:00 P.M. - 2:30 P.M.\n      Invited talks - Software & Tooling\n      \n      \n        \n          Chair: To be confirmed\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n              \n              \n                Speaker: C\n              \n              \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                B\n              \n              \n                Speaker: E\n              \n              \n                D\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      2:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.\n      Afternoon tea\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      3:00 P.M. - 4:30 P.M.\n      Panel discussion - Data Science Teams and Workflows\n      \n      \n        \n          Chair: To be confirmed\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                Speaker: P\n              \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                Speaker: A\n              \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                Speaker: W\n              \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      4:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.\n      Closing discussion\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items"

This practical workshop, led by Dr Jess Hopf from Knowlegible Designs, introduces core graphic design principles and demonstrates how they can be applied to scientific figures to improve clarity, impact, and accessibility.\nThrough a mix of theory and hands-on application, we’ll cover cognitive load, visual hierarchies, common communication pitfalls (like the curse of knowledge), and a step-by-step process for building and refining figures. Attendees are encouraged to bring a visual they’re currently working on, as there will be opportunities to apply workshop concepts and receive feedback.\nYou don’t need any prior design experience or specialist software. This workshop is suitable for researchers at any career stage who want to elevate the quality and communicative power of their visual materials."

He has been a specialised R user for seventeen years, and has recently joined The R Journal as an Associate Editor. He is the author of several R packages, available at https://bsvars.org/, that combine blazingly fast algorithms written in C++ with the convenience of data analysis in R. He works as a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, where he has an extensive research, teaching, and engagement portfolio. He is also an external collaborator at the International Labour Organization, where he develops a new forecasting system and an R package."

In short:\nStep 1: Install a C++ compiler: for Windows: install RTools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/); for macOS:install Xcode Command Line Tools (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/) and gfortran (https://www.scivision.dev/homebrew-install-fortran-compiler/), and for Linux: install the standard development packages.\nStep 2: Install the Rcpp and RcppArmadillo packages by running in R: library(Rcpp); library(RcppArmadillo)\nStep 3: Check if the installation is successful. Source the file nicetry.cpp in RStudio by executing: Rcpp::sourceCpp(“nicetry.cpp”). If you see a matrix with values 1, 2, and 3 in R, you’re good to go for the workshop.\nWe apologise, but we cannot assist any further with the preparations.\nEvening third workshop details"

    "text": "Dr Jess Hopf, Knowlegible Designs\nClear, well-designed figures are essential for effectively communicating scientific ideas, but good design is often overlooked in academic training. This practical workshop, led by Dr Jess Hopf from Knowlegible Designs, introduces core graphic design principles and demonstrates how they can be applied to scientific figures to improve clarity, impact, and accessibility.\nThrough a mix of theory and hands-on application, we’ll cover cognitive load, visual hierarchies, common communication pitfalls (like the curse of knowledge), and a step-by-step process for building and refining figures. Attendees are encouraged to bring a visual they’re currently working on, as there will be opportunities to apply workshop concepts and receive feedback.\nYou don’t need any prior design experience or specialist software. This workshop is suitable for researchers at any career stage who want to elevate the quality and communicative power of their visual materials."
