    "text": "Keynote\n\n\n\n  \n    \n     Nicola Rennie \n     Nicola Rennie is a data visualisation specialist, working at the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom. She has a background in statistics and data science, who is interested in understanding how to effectively communicate quantitative information in an accessible way. She advocates for using open source tools, and has experience in D3, Svelte, R, and Python. Nicola co-authored the Royal Statistical Society’s Best Practices for Data Visualisation guidance and is a member of the Editorial Board of Significance magazine, particularly focused on data visualisation. Nicola is a committee member and secretary of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) Teaching Statistics Section Group, and is also one of the RSS’s 2024-2025 William Guy Lecturers who has recorded and delivered talks aimed at 11-16 year olds on the topic of using data and statistics to shape decision making in medicine and healthcare. She has also previously been a committee member of the R-Ladies Global Team and the R-Ladies Lancaster chapter organiser.\n \n  \n  \n     Designing for decision-making: How to build effective data visualisations \n     Data visualisation can be a very efficient method of identifying patterns in data and communicating findings to broad audiences. Good data visualisation requires appreciation and careful consideration of the technical aspects of data presentation. But it also involves a creative element. Authorial choices are made about the “story” we want to tell, and design decisions are driven by the need to convey that story most effectively to our audience. Software systems use default settings for most graphical elements. However, each visualisation has its own story to tell, and so we must actively consider and choose settings for the visualisation we are building. In this talk, Nicola will showcase why you should visualise data, present some guidelines for making more effective charts, before discussing examples of good and not so good charts.\n \n  \n\n\nNo matching items"

At the same time, data analysts and data scientists know they need to adopt reproducible methods to maintain the integrity and efficacy of their work. These characteristics of data analysis work can be in tension, but the processes we adopt and the tools we choose to use can bring those tensions into balance. In this talk, learn about the considerations tool creators must consider when building software for these kinds of tasks, as well as how data scientists and other data practitioners can engage in their iterative work while maintaining reproducible workflows. This talk will explore these issues in the context of tools like Quarto and Positron; Positron is a new, next generation integrated development environment (IDE) built to facilitate both exploratory data analysis as well as reproducible practices.\n\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      10:00 A.M. - 10:30 A.M.\n      Morning tea\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.\n      Invited talks - Communications and reporting\n      \n      \n        \n          Chair: To be confirmed\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                Speaker: U\n              \n              \n                T\n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                Speaker: Q\n              \n              \n                I\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      12:00 P.M. - 1:00 P.M.\n      Lunch\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      1:00 P.M. - 2:30 P.M.\n      Invited talks - Software & Tooling\n      \n      \n        \n          Chair: To be confirmed\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n              \n              \n                Speaker: C\n              \n              \n                V\n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n                B\n              \n              \n                Speaker: E\n              \n              \n                D\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      2:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.\n      Afternoon tea\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      3:00 P.M. - 4:30 P.M.\n      Panel discussion - Data Science Teams and Workflows\n      \n      \n        \n          Chair: To be confirmed\n        \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                Speaker: P\n              \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                Speaker: A\n              \n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n              \n                Speaker: W\n              \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      4:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.\n      Closing discussion\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items"

This tutorial provides an overview of uncertainty, examines how it is represented in R, and introduces a range of techniques for visualising it. The first session will introduce the concept of uncertainty and cover general visualisation approaches. The second session will focus on spatial data and the creative methods that emerge when uncertainty must be expressed using only a limited set of visual aesthetics. Wherever there are statistics and data, there is uncertainty, making the ability to visualise it effectively an essential skill for any statistician."

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to time series analytics and forecasting using R, utilising the tidyverse and tidy time series tools to enable analysis across many time series. Attendees will learn about commonly seen time series patterns, and how to find them with specialised time series graphics created with ggplot2. Then we will use fable to capture these patterns with statistical time series models, and produce probabilistic forecasts. Finally, participants will gain insights into evaluating model performance, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their forecasts. Through a combination of foundational concepts and practical demonstrations, this tutorial equips participants with the skills to extract meaningful insights from time series data for informed decision-making in various domains."

    "text": "Mitchell O’Hara-Wild (he/him)\nOrganisations of all types collect vast amounts of time series data, and there is a growing need for time series analytics to understand how things change in our fast-moving world. This tutorial provides a practical introduction to time series analytics and forecasting using R, utilising the tidyverse and tidy time series tools to enable analysis across many time series. Attendees will learn about commonly seen time series patterns, and how to find them with specialised time series graphics created with ggplot2. Then we will use fable to capture these patterns with statistical time series models, and produce probabilistic forecasts. Finally, participants will gain insights into evaluating model performance, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their forecasts. Through a combination of foundational concepts and practical demonstrations, this tutorial equips participants with the skills to extract meaningful insights from time series data for informed decision-making in various domains."

    "text": "Harriet Mason\nFrom exploring variability in a dataset to communicating the distribution of estimates, uncertainty visualisation plays a role at every stage of data analysis. This tutorial provides an overview of uncertainty, examines how it is represented in R, and introduces a range of techniques for visualising it. The first session will introduce the concept of uncertainty and cover general visualisation approaches. The second session will focus on spatial data and the creative methods that emerge when uncertainty must be expressed using only a limited set of visual aesthetics. Wherever there are statistics and data, there is uncertainty, making the ability to visualise it effectively an essential skill for any statistician.\nMorning third workshop details"
