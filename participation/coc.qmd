### Code of Conduct

The organizers of **WOMBAT 2025** are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). Organizers will enforce this code throughout and expect cooperation in ensuring a safe environment for all.

We do not tolerate harassment of WOMBAT 2025 participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, conference events, or other online media.

Participants engaging in harassing behavior may be sanctioned in any way organizers deem appropriate. Participants may be given a formal warning to stop the behavior and expelled if they continue, or immediately expelled from the conference without refund. Additionally, if the harassing behavior is part of a talk, the display will be removed or the talk stopped, as well as the other responses listed above.

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at WOMBAT 2025 have agreed to:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
  - Deliberate intimidation.
  - Unwanted photography or recording.
  - Discriminatory images in public spaces.
  - Sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events.
  - Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes.
  - Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or sexuality.
  - Inappropriate physical contact, which can include grabbing as well as hugging without asking, or massaging without asking.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favours, or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information.
  - Stalking.
- Alert a member of the code of conduct response team (listed below) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

If you are asked to stop a particular behaviour you should stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke. It was clearly not taken that way and, for the comfort of all conference attendees, you should stop.

## Requirements for talks

Talk slides and presentations fall under the code of conduct. Talk slides should not contain offensive or sexualized material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites), the existence of this material should be noted both in the abstract and at the start of the talk.
