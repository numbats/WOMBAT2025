title: Introduction to Regression Analysis in R
description: Regression analysis is a widely used quantitative method applicable across
  many sectors. This session covers the theory and application of linear and generalized
  linear regression models, model validation and diagnostics, Poisson regression for
  count data, and best practices for communicating results, all with hands-on exercises
  in R.

Regression analysis is one of the most widely used and powerful quantitative analysis methods used across almost every sector. This workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to commonly used regression models, including the theory behind these models, their application in R, validation techniques, and the interpretation of results. The course begins with an introduction to linear regression models, before advancing to the more flexible family of generalised linear models.


Topics covered as part of this course include:

* Linear regression: concepts, assumptions, application, and interpretations
* Diagnostics and validation of linear regression models
* Generalised linear models: beyond continuous outcomes
* Poisson regression: how to model counts and rates, and how this differs from linear regression
* Best practices in communicating results of regression analysis

Participants will leave with a solid grounding (or refresher) in how to correctly perform hands-on regression modelling tasks in R for a variety of problems.
