title: Visualising Uncertainty
description: Uncertainty visualisation is essential throughout data analysis, from
  exploring variability to communicating estimate distributions. The session will
  introduce the concept of uncertainty, general techniques for visualising it, and
  creative methods for representing uncertainty in spatial data using R.

# Visualising Uncertainty

::: {.g-col-12 .full_text_block}

From exploring variability in a dataset to communicating the distribution of estimates, uncertainty visualisation plays a role at every stage of data analysis. This tutorial provides an overview of uncertainty, examines how it is represented in R, and introduces a range of techniques for visualising it. The first session will introduce the concept of uncertainty and cover general visualisation approaches. The second session will focus on spatial data and the creative methods that emerge when uncertainty must be expressed using only a limited set of visual aesthetics. Wherever there are statistics and data, there is uncertainty, making the ability to visualise it effectively an essential skill for any statistician.

## Harriet Mason

[Harriet Mason](https://harrietmason.netlify.app/) is a final year PhD student. She is researching how uncertainty can be effectively communicated through statistical graphics, particularly in contexts where misleading interpretations must be actively avoided. She is the author of several R packages, including `cassowaryr` and `ggdibbler`.
