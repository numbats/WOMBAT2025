title: Introduction to R packages
description: This session is designed for R users interested in turning their standalone
  code into shareable R packages but have not yet ventured into package development.
  Key topics include structuring R packages, managing dependencies with `usethis`
  and `devtools`, documenting code with `roxygen2`, testing with `testthat`, sharing
  packages using Git and GitHub, and an introduction to advanced steps like continuous
  integration, R Universe deployment, and website creation with `pkgdown`.

Do you have R code you want to share? You can transform your R code into a shareable tool by developing it into an R package. This course bridges the gap between writing isolated R functions and creating documented packages that can be easily distributed, and is designed for those who might be curious about R package development but haven't had the time or guidance to get started.

You'll learn the essential tools of the trade: `usethis` and `devtools` for package structure, `roxygen2` for documentation, `testthat` for testing, and Git/GitHub for sharing your work.

Whether you're looking to organise your personal code collection or contribute to the broader R ecosystem, this course provides the foundation you need.

**Prerequisites**:

- Comfortable with some R fundamentals (data types, functions, reading data).
- Experience writing basic R scripts.
- No prior experience with package development required.

**Learning Outcomes**: By the end of this course, you will be able to:  
 
- Create the basic structure of an R package.
- Manage dependencies with `usethis` and `devtools`.
- Create documentation with `roxygen2`.
- Write and run unit tests with `testthat` to verify package functionality.
- Use Git and GitHub to put your R package online.
- Understand next steps for advanced package development, including:
- Automatically run tests with continuous integration via GitHub Actions.
- Make your R package easily installable with the [R Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search).
- Create professional package websites using `pkgdown`.

## Nicholas Tierney

Dr. Nicholas (Nick) Tierney is a [Research Software Engineer](https://researchsoftware.org/), and freelance consultant with a PhD in Statistics who specialises in data analytics, R package development, and teaching. He wrote his first R package in 2015, [neato](https://github.com/njtierney/neato), after being inspired by Dr. Hilary Parker's blog post [&quot;writing an R package from scratch&quot;](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/).

His academic work has produced several widely-used packages (see [his github](http://github.com/njtierney)). During his research fellowship at Monash University with [Professor Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org/),  he developed tools for exploratory data analysis including [visdat](https://docs.ropensci.org/visdat/), [naniar](https://naniar.njtierney.com/), and [brolgar](https://brolgar.njtierney.com/) . He then went on to work with [Professor Nick Golding](https://www.thekids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/), working as a research software engineer to translate research methods into R packages. Specifically, [conmat](http://github.com/idem-lab/conmat) a tool used in pandemic modelling, and he maintained Nick Golding's [greta](https://greta-stats.org/)  R package for statistical modelling using Google's [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Beyond coding, Nick actively writes about R related projects at his blog, [&quot;credibly curious&quot;](https://www.njtierney.com/). When not coding, Nick enjoys outdoor adventures and hiked the entire Pacific Crest Trail in 2023, documenting his journey at [njt.micro.blog](https://njt.micro.blog/).
