# Building Better Figures: A Scientific Graphic Design Workshop

## Dr Jess Hopf, Knowlegible Designs

Clear, well-designed figures are essential for effectively communicating scientific ideas, but good design is often overlooked in academic training. This practical workshop, led by Dr Jess Hopf from Knowlegible Designs, introduces core graphic design principles and demonstrates how they can be applied to scientific figures to improve clarity, impact, and accessibility.

Through a mix of theory and hands-on application, we’ll cover cognitive load, visual hierarchies, common communication pitfalls (like the curse of knowledge), and a step-by-step process for building and refining figures. Attendees are encouraged to bring a visual they’re currently working on, as there will be opportunities to apply workshop concepts and receive feedback.

You don't need any prior design experience or specialist software. This workshop is suitable for researchers at any career stage who want to elevate the quality and communicative power of their visual materials.
