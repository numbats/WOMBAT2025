# Efficiency Analysis in Python: A Hands-On Tutorial on Stochastic Frontier Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis

This tutorial introduces participants to two cornerstone methods in efficiency and productivity analysis: Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Aimed at researchers and practitioners in economics, operations research, and analytics, the session combines conceptual grounding with practical implementation in Python.

We will begin with an overview of the theoretical foundations of SFA and DEA, highlighting their assumptions, use cases, and differences. The tutorial then walks through hands-on examples using Python libraries, covering model specification, estimation, and interpretation of results. No prior experience with SFA or DEA is required, but familiarity with basic regression and Python programming will be beneficial.
