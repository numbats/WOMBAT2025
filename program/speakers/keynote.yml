  title: Reproducible data analysis with Positron 
  abstract: |
    The process of data analysis is inherently iterative and exploratory, requiring continuous review of intermediate results to guide next steps. At the same time, data analysts and data scientists know they need to adopt reproducible methods to maintain the integrity and efficacy of their work. These characteristics of data analysis work can be in tension, but the processes we adopt and the tools we choose to use can bring those tensions into balance. In this talk, learn about the considerations tool creators must consider when building software for these kinds of tasks, as well as how data scientists and other data practitioners can engage in their iterative work while maintaining reproducible workflows. This talk will explore these issues in the context of tools like Quarto and Positron; Positron is a new, next generation integrated development environment (IDE) built to facilitate both exploratory data analysis as well as reproducible practices.
