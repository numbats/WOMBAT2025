title: Tidy analysis of preferential votes with prefio
description: Preferential datasets, often structured as rankings across multiple columns
  or rows, can be cumbersome to work with. The `prefio` R package will be introduced,
  demonstrating a tidy method for managing preferences and providing convenient operations
  for manipulating preferential data, and an interactive component will also be included.

Preferential datasets usually represent rankings for an individual voter across multiple columns or rows in a rectangular format. This can make working with these datasets cumbersome and unintuitive.

This talk will introduce `prefio`, an R package that lets you work with preferences in a tidy way without spanning multiple rows or columns, while providing convenient operations for manipulating preferential data.

There will be an interactive component to the talk, so get ready to cast some votes!
