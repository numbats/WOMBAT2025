Research software engineering, open source software, reproducibility research -- what do these terms really mean, and what's special about creating 'statistical software' and R packages? In this conversation with Professor Rob Hyndman, and Dr. Nick Tierney, we attempt to demystify and highlight many ways that software design and open source packages can contribute to the development, dissemination and accessibility of data-driven analysis.

:::{.speaker-bio}
Dr. Nicholas (Nick) Tierney is a [Research Software Engineer](https://researchsoftware.org/), and freelance consultant with a PhD in Statistics who specialises in data analytics, R package development, and teaching. He wrote his first R package in 2015, [neato](https://github.com/njtierney/neato), after being inspired by Dr. Hilary Parker's blog post [&quot;writing an R package from scratch&quot;](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/).

His academic work has produced several widely-used packages (see [his github](http://github.com/njtierney)). During his research fellowship at Monash University with [Professor Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org/),  he developed tools for exploratory data analysis including [visdat](https://docs.ropensci.org/visdat/), [naniar](https://naniar.njtierney.com/), and [brolgar](https://brolgar.njtierney.com/) . He then went on to work with [Professor Nick Golding](https://www.thekids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/), working as a research software engineer to translate research methods into R packages. Specifically, [conmat](http://github.com/idem-lab/conmat) a tool used in pandemic modelling, and he maintained Nick Golding's [greta](https://greta-stats.org/)  R package for statistical modelling using Google's [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Beyond coding, Nick actively writes about R related projects at his blog, [&quot;credibly curious&quot;](https://www.njtierney.com/). When not coding, Nick enjoys outdoor adventures and hiked the entire Pacific Crest Trail in 2023, documenting his journey at [njt.micro.blog](https://njt.micro.blog/).
