description: In this talk, the speaker shares how they find joy in developing personal tools to simplify tasks,
  even when their creation is time-intensive. Several specific creations will be showcased,
  including the `teleport` GitHub Action, the `Comment Viewer` Positron extension,
  the `Unilur` Quarto filter for assignment solutions, and a gamified teaching tool
  for ggplot2, alongside a discussion on the mindset of valuing "lazy" problem-solvers.

Nothing gives me greater joy than building little tools to make my life easier — even if they take ten times longer to make than they’ll ever save. In this talk I’ll share a few of these creations and the mindset behind them: the `teleport` GitHub Action, _Comment Viewer_ Positron extension, _Unilur_ Quarto filter for generating assignment solutions, and a sneak peek at a gamified teaching tool for ggplot2. Along the way, I’ll argue that sometimes it’s not the smartest hire you need, but the laziest one — a sentiment probably attributed to Bill Gates (though I’ve never bothered to check).
