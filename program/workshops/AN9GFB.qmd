Scrollytelling is an innovative way to tell data-driven stories, but it often demands sophisticated data visualisation engineering skills and budgets beyond individual researchers and small newsrooms. [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/) makes scrollytelling accessible and easy for researchers and analysts using their existing Quarto authoring skills.

â€‹In this talk, James discusses some of the factors that motivated Closeread's design, the first scrollytelling contest with Posit, and new features on the horizon, including scrolling video support and better integration with R and Python tools.
