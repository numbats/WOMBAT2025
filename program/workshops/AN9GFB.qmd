title: Closing the scrollytelling gap with Closeread
description: Scrollytelling is a powerful but often inaccessible method for presenting
  data-driven stories due to technical barriers. This session covers the motivations
  behind the design of Closeread, details from the first Posit scrollytelling contest,
  and upcoming features such as scrolling video support and improved integration with
  R and Python.

Scrollytelling is an innovative way to tell data-driven stories, but it often demands sophisticated data visualisation engineering skills and budgets beyond individual researchers and small newsrooms. [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/) makes scrollytelling accessible and easy for researchers and analysts using their existing Quarto authoring skills.

â€‹In this talk, James discusses some of the factors that motivated Closeread's design, the first scrollytelling contest with Posit, and new features on the horizon, including scrolling video support and better integration with R and Python tools.
